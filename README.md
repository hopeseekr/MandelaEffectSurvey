# Mandela Effect Survey and Profiler

A survey system for profiling Mandela Effects and their observers.
Made in PHP, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

Hopefully, this app will help us shed light on this mysterious phenomenon. It strives
to answer the following questions:

1. What reality discongruities (e.g, double-think) have been observed by many people?
2. How many people?
3. Where do they live?
4. When were they born?
5. Do they share personality traits? E.g., Intuitive, Feeling, Perceptive? Empathic?
6. How sure are they of the observations?
7. Will they get the control questions right or wrong?
8. Is the process accelerating, as many feel it is?
9. Can a map of parallel realities be created via this survey?
